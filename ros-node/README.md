c++ [ROS](http://www.ros.org/) node wrapper for a set of [hc-sr04](http://www.micropik.com/PDF/HCSR04.pdf) ultrasonic sonars.

![hc-sr04](hc_sr04.jpg)

Publishes [sensor_msgs::Range](http://docs.ros.org/jade/api/sensor_msgs/html/msg/Range.html) messages at 10Hz to `/sonarN` topics. Specifically populates `range`.

We include a node for a set of sonars, rather than a node per sonar, since we need to ensure only one sonar is measuring at a time (sonars can easily interfere with each other)

on rasp pi 2 uses ~2% cpu and <1% mem for 3 sonars (capping at a distance of 20cm)

REQUIRES running `src/export_gpio_pins.sh` to export pins otherwise need to run as root. (limitation of `wiringPiSetupSys`)
